# Task Management Application - Development Roadmap

## üìã **Project Overview**
This roadmap outlines the steps to complete your console-based task management application built with Java using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. The application currently supports basic CRUD operations with XML persistence.

---

## üéØ **Current State Assessment**

### ‚úÖ **Completed Features**
- MVC architecture implementation
- Task model with UUID, title, description, date, and completion status
- XML-based data persistence
- Console-based user interface
- Basic CRUD operations:
    - Create new tasks
    - Read/display tasks
    - Update task properties (title, description, status)
    - Delete tasks
- Task editing functionality
- Database singleton pattern

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issues**
- Status toggle functionality exists but may not be properly integrated
- Data persistence validation needed
- Limited error handling for edge cases
- Unused methods in controller

---

## üõ§Ô∏è **Development Phases**

### **Phase 1: Core Functionality Stabilization** (HIGH PRIORITY)
*Estimated Time: 2-3 days*

#### 1.1 Data Persistence Verification
- [ ] **Test XML persistence**: Verify all CRUD operations properly save to and load from XML file
- [ ] **Fix delete operation**: Ensure deleted tasks are removed from XML storage, not just memory
- [ ] **Validate data integrity**: Test app restart after operations to confirm persistence

#### 1.2 Error Handling & Validation
- [ ] **Input validation**: Prevent empty task titles and descriptions
- [ ] **Bounds checking**: Validate task selection indices
- [ ] **Scanner exception handling**: Handle invalid input types gracefully
- [ ] **XML file corruption protection**: Handle missing or corrupted XML files

#### 1.3 Code Cleanup
- [ ] **Review unused methods**: Either integrate `changeTaskStatus()` or remove unused code
- [ ] **Eliminate code duplication**: Refactor repetitive validation logic
- [ ] **Fix menu navigation**: Ensure consistent user flow between all menu options

---

### **Phase 2: User Experience Enhancement** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
*Estimated Time: 3-4 days*

#### 2.1 Improved Menu System
- [ ] **Add navigation options**: "Return to Main Menu" in all sub-menus
- [ ] **Confirmation dialogs**: Add "Are you sure?" for delete operations
- [ ] **Clear screen functionality**: Improve visual separation between operations
- [ ] **Menu numbering consistency**: Ensure all menus follow same numbering pattern

#### 2.2 Enhanced Task Display
- [ ] **Status indicators**: Show completion status in task lists (‚úì for completed, ‚úó for incomplete)
- [ ] **Date formatting**: Display creation dates in user-friendly format
- [ ] **Task summaries**: Show task count and completion statistics
- [ ] **Better task selection**: Display tasks with clear numbering and status

#### 2.3 Input Improvements
- [ ] **Trim whitespace**: Remove leading/trailing spaces from all inputs
- [ ] **Case-insensitive operations**: Handle user inputs consistently
- [ ] **Input length limits**: Prevent extremely long titles/descriptions
- [ ] **Special character handling**: Ensure XML-safe character processing

---

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features** (OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS)
*Estimated Time: 4-5 days*

#### 3.1 Search & Filter Capabilities
- [ ] **Search functionality**: Find tasks by title or description keywords
- [ ] **Status filtering**: Show only completed or incomplete tasks
- [ ] **Date-based filtering**: Display tasks created within date ranges
- [ ] **Sorting options**: Sort tasks by date, title, or completion status

#### 3.2 Data Management Features
- [ ] **Export functionality**: Save tasks to CSV or JSON format
- [ ] **Import tasks**: Load tasks from external files
- [ ] **Backup system**: Create automatic backups of task data
- [ ] **Data statistics**: Show task completion rates and creation trends

#### 3.3 Enhanced Task Properties
- [ ] **Due dates**: Add optional due dates for tasks
- [ ] **Task priorities**: Implement High/Medium/Low priority levels
- [ ] **Categories/Tags**: Add task categorization system
- [ ] **Task notes**: Add additional notes or comments to tasks

---

### **Phase 4: Code Quality & Documentation** (ONGOING)
*Estimated Time: 2-3 days*

#### 4.1 Code Refactoring
- [ ] **Constants extraction**: Replace magic numbers with named constants
- [ ] **Method naming**: Ensure all method names clearly describe their purpose
- [ ] **Code commenting**: Add comprehensive JavaDoc comments
- [ ] **Package organization**: Ensure proper package structure and imports

#### 4.2 Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Unit tests**: Create tests for core functionality
- [ ] **Integration tests**: Test complete user workflows
- [ ] **Edge case testing**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
- [ ] **Performance testing**: Ensure app performs well with large task lists

#### 4.3 Documentation
- [ ] **README update**: Complete usage instructions and setup guide
- [ ] **API documentation**: Document all public methods and classes
- [ ] **User manual**: Create end-user documentation
- [ ] **Developer guide**: Document architecture and extension points

## üèÅ **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Checklist**

To consider your console app "complete," ensure these core features work flawlessly:

- [ ] **Task Creation**: Users can create new tasks with title and description
- [ ] **Task Viewing**: All tasks display with proper formatting and status indicators
- [ ] **Task Editing**: Users can modify task title, description, and completion status
- [ ] **Task Deletion**: Tasks can be removed with confirmation
- [ ] **Data Persistence**: All operations save to and load from XML file correctly
- [ ] **Error Handling**: App handles invalid inputs without crashing
- [ ] **Menu Navigation**: Clear, intuitive menu system with proper flow
- [ ] **Application Stability**: App runs reliably through multiple use sessions

---

## üöÄ **Quick Wins (Immediate Actions)**

Start with these high-impact, low-effort improvements:

1. **Test Data Persistence** (30 minutes)
    - Run app, perform various operations, restart, and verify data persisted correctly

2. **Add Basic Input Validation** (1 hour)
    - Prevent empty task titles and descriptions
    - Add simple error messages for invalid inputs

3. **Improve Menu Flow** (45 minutes)
    - Add "Return to Main Menu" options in sub-menus
    - Ensure consistent user experience

4. **Clean Up Unused Code** (30 minutes)
    - Review and either implement or remove unused methods
    - Clean up commented-out code

## üéì **OOP Learning Objectives Progress**

Track your mastery of Object-Oriented Programming principles:

### ‚úÖ **Currently Demonstrated**
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields, controlled access through getters/setters
- **Abstraction**: Clean separation between MVC layers, hiding implementation details

### üîÑ **Partially Demonstrated**
- **Inheritance**: Could be enhanced with task subtypes (WorkTask, PersonalTask, etc.)
- **Polymorphism**: Could implement different storage backends (XML, JSON, Database)

### üí° **Enhancement Opportunities**
- Create abstract Task base class with specialized implementations
- Implement Storage interface with multiple concrete implementations
- Use polymorphic collections for different task types
